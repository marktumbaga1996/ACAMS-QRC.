Overview
The Automated Class Attendance Monitoring System (ACAMS-QRC) is a QR code-based attendance system designed to streamline and automate the process of recording student attendance in educational settings. By allowing students to scan unique QR codes as they enter the classroom, teachers can efficiently log attendance without the need for manual roll calls. The app also includes real-time notifications to parents or guardians, keeping them informed of their child’s attendance status.
This system helps reduce administrative workload, improve accuracy, and save valuable time that teachers can use for other important tasks.
